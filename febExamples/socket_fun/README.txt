# Board Setup

1.) Flash Standarda Firmata to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE (already done unless reflashed)
2.) LED longest pin to GND, any of the other 3 pins to pin 13
3.) Button one terminal to GND, the other terminal to pin 8
4.) node app.js
5.) Visit localhost:3333 in the browser
6,) Use something metal to press the "button" (e.g. a quarter, ring etc.)

Note: Sometimes it's finicky ; if it isn't working simply CTRL-c the node command and try again
